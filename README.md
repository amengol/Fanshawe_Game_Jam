# Game Engine 101
This is somewhat my first attempt to create a Game Engine. This code started durig the first semester of the Game Development - Advanced Programming at Fanshawe College in 2017.

### Notice:
This repo would and certainly still contains code developed in class during the course, either by me or by some professor, however, there is no intention to violate any copyright material of any kind.

As the code matures, the idea is to make new implementations of new concepts as well as change the old code to a better state.
